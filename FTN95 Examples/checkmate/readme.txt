These programs illustrate the use of FTN95's CHECKMATE technology.  This
powerful debugging mechanism traps many of the difficult to deteect
programming errors at runtime.

Each program is documented in comment lines at the top of each source file.

To build the executables run the batch file BUILDALL.BAT from the command
line.
