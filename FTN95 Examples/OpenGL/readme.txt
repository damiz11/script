This directory contains examples using OpenGL and ClearWin+.

Note that ClearWin+ OpenGL support requires a graphics mode
with more than 256 colours (e.g. Hi-Colour or Truecolour)

To compile these programs use the file BUILD.BAT in this directory.
For example, to build the TEAPOTS.FOR demo use

    BUILD TEAPOTS

NOTE: you may need to edit the BUILD.BAT file to use the correct
locations of the opengl libraries.

SIMPLE.FOR must be built before DOUBLE.FOR
